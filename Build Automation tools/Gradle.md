# Gradle

Is an open-source build automation tool that builds upon the concepts of _Apache ant_ and introduces a _Groovy_ based _domain-specific language (DSL)_ instead of _xml_ form used by _Apache maven_ for declaring project configuration. Gradle uses a _directed acyclinc graph (DAG)_ to determine the order in which tasks can be run.

* Gradle is designed for mult-project builds
