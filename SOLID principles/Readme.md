# SOLID Principles

SOLID are five basic principles for handling improving software architecture, and avoid spaghetti code.

Solid Stands for

* S - Single Responsibility Principle
* O - Open Closed Principle
* L - Liskov Substitution Principle
* I - Interface Segregation Principle
* D - Dependency Inversion Principle

## S - SRP: Single Responsibility Principle

Every module or  a class in a program should have only one responsibility over a single part of the functionality provided by the software, and that responsibility should be entirely encapsulated by the class. All its services should be narrowly aligned with that responsibility.

Robert C martin expresses this principle as "A class should have only one reason to change".

## O - OCP: Open Closed Principle

## L - LSP: Liskov Substitution Principle

## I - ISP: Interface Segregation Principle

## D - DIP: Dependency Inversion Principle
