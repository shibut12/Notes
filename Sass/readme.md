# Sass

Sass is a CSS Pre processor. A scripting language that extends CSS and gets compiled into regular CSS syntax.

## Why SASS

* More maintainable code - Sass provides `functions` and `variables` to avoid __DRY__ _css code_
* Code reuse
* Compass - A framework that built on Sass, which allows to generate cross browser code
* Avoid browser prefixes
* Compression

## SCSS

* Saas's SCSS syntax is super set of CSS
