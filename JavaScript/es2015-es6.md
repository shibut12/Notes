# ES 2015 - ES 6

New way to improve javascript code.

## Right parts

### => Arrow function

Is the new way of declaring function. They are syntactically anonymous.

```js
// ES6
foo => 2;
// Pre ES6
function foo() {
    return 2;
}
```

If there is not curley brace `{}` around the right side of arrow function, it implies a return. For Example, `foo => 2;` mean, function foo returns value 2. 
If the body of the arrow function is expression, it has to be wrapped in a curley braces `{}`. In this case, there will not be an _implicit return_.

```js
// Example
x => { try { return 3; } catch(e) {} }
```

To return a json object, the json object should be wrapped in parenthesis.

```js
//Example
x=> ({ y: x })
```

#### Name inferrencing

A way to assign a name to anonymous arrow function.

```js
var foo = x => 3;
foo.name = foo;
```

#### Arrow functions vs named function or down sides to using anonymous functions

* Named function are better when you have to self reference to itself, for example in recursion
* Anonymous functions show up as anonymous in stacktrace
