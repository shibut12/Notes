# Micro front-end architecture

In a nutshell, _Micro front-end architecture_ is micro services design principles applied to _front-end_ layer of application.

## Micro services design principles

Micro services are all about smaller components in the form of APIs.

### High Cohesion

Each api or service or Micro service have one responsibility and one focus.

### Autonomous

Each micro service can be independently changed without affecting other services.

### Business domain centric

Each service represent specific business domain or business function within the organization.

### Resiliency

When a service fail to function, it should be replaced without visible to the end user.

### Observable

By using centralized logging /monitoring each micro service can be observed.

### Automation

Each micro service should be able to tested independently.
