# Design Patterns

Are solutions to software design problems that you find again and again in real-world application development. Patterns are about reusable designs and interactions.

The 23 Gang Of Four (GoF) patternsa re generally considered the foundation for all other patterns. They are categoriazed as __Creational__, __Structural__ and __Behavioral__.

## Creational Patterns

### Abstract Factory
Creates an instance of several families of classes.

### Builder 
Separates object construction from its representation.

### Factory Method
Creates an instance of several derived classes.

### Prototype
A fully initialized instance to be copied or cloned.

### Singleton
A class of which only a single instance can exist.

## Structural Patterns

### Adapter
Match interfaces if different classes.

### Bridge
Seperates an object's interface from its implementation.

### Composite
A tree structure of simple and composite objects

### Decorator
Add responsibilities to objects dynamically.

### Facade
A single class that represents an entire subsystem.

### Flyweight
A fine-grained instance used for efficient sharing.
### Proxy
An object representing another object.

## Behavioral Patterns

### Chain of Responsibility
A way of passing a request between a chain of objects.

### Command
Encapsulate a command request as an object.

### Interpreter
A way to include language elements of a collection.

### Iterator
Sequentially access elements of a collection.

### Mediator
Defines simplified communication between classes.

### Memonto
Capture and restore an object's internal state.

### Observer
A way of notifying change to a number of classes.

### State
Alter an object's behavior when its state changes.

### Strategy
Encapsulate an algorithm inside a class.

### Template method
Defer the exact steps of an algorithm to a subclass.

### Visitor
Defines a new operation to a class without change
