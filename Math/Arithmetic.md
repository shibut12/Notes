## LCM Least Common Multiple

The _LCM_ of two integers _a_ and _b_ (usually denoted by __LCM(a,b)__ ), is the smallest positive integer that is divisible by both a and b. Since division of integers by zero is undefined, this definition has meaning only if a and b are both different from zero. 

### Examples

* What is the LCM of 4 and 6.

    Multiples of 4 are:
    4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28,36,...
    Multiples of 6 are:
    6, 12, 18, 24, 36, 42, 48,...

    Common multiples of 4 and 6 are:
    12, 24,36,...

    From the list, the least common multiple (LCM) is 12.
