Is a style of _object oriented programming_, in which __Inheritance__ (behavior reuse) is performed via a process of reusing objects via delegation that serve as _prototypes_. This method is also known as _Prototype-based programming_, _prototype-oriented_, _classless_, or _instance based programming_.
